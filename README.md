# DiscordBot
In the master branch sits an older version of a discord bot built with discord4j 2.x.x and slf4j. It can do a few commands, like deleting messages with a server it is in, or a simple tic-tac-toe game.

In the audio-bot branch is a bot with discord4j 3.x.x , lavaplayer, and org.json for json utilities. This bot can join voice channels and play music specified at specific URLs. Additional functionality with Google's Youtube Data v3 API was added to search for videos on Youtube.
